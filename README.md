## Introduction
This project mainly simulates four Manipulator control algorithms: 

1. Linear Camera Space Manipulation (**LCSM**)
2. Image-Based Visual Servo with monocular vision system (**Monocular IBVS**)
3. Image-Based Visual Servo with binocular vision system (**Binocular IBVS**)
4. Position-Based Visual Servo with binocular vision system (**Binocular PBVS**)

These algorithms are applied to a 6R PUMA robot manipulator using Robotics Toolbox.

## Prerequisites
Before running code, make sure you have **Robotics Toolbox** installed in Matlab.

> [Robotics Toolbox (RTB)](http://petercorke.com/wordpress/toolboxes/robotics-toolbox) is a useful Matlab toolbox, which provides functions related to robotics. You can click the link to download RTB and install it. 

All codes have **Only** been tested on 
* Windows10 1809 
* Matlab R2018b 
* Robotics Toolbox 10.3.1

There is no guarantee that the codes have good compatibility in other versions. 


## Usage
Four folders in the repository represent four control algorithms. Double-click `Main.m` in the each folder to start simulation of corresponding control algorithm. 

That‘s simple~ Enjoy playing robot!!
